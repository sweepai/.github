## Hello there 👋

Sweep is a Github assistant the helps you fix small bugs and implement small features. You write tickets and Sweep fixes them so you can focus on the challenging engineering problems.

For some examples of tickets made by Sweep, check out https://github.com/edreisMD/plugnplai/issues/140, https://github.com/edreisMD/plugnplai/issues/122 and [🎟️ Example Sweep Tickets](https://www.notion.so/sweep-ai/Example-Sweep-tickets-238f7c88fe3e4153bdea137de30ee7c1?pvs=4) for more.

## Getting started

To install, click the green install button. Then add the repository you want, make a quick ticket (e.g. writing tests), prepend the ticket with "Sweep:" and watch the magic happen. 🚀🔮

Don't have a good repo to try it out? Head over to our forks of [Create React App](https://github.com/sweepai/create-react-app/issues) and [MiniChain](https://github.com/sweepai/minichain/issues). Make a quick ticket and prefix the title with "Sweep:" (not case-sensitive) and let Sweep handle the rest. 🛠️✅
