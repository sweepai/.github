## Hello there 👋

Sweep is a Github assistant the helps you fix small bugs and implement small features. You write tickets and Sweep fixes them so you can focus on the challenging engineering problems.

## Example Tickets

For some examples of effective PR's made by Sweep, check out https://github.com/edreisMD/plugnplai/issues/140 and https://github.com/edreisMD/plugnplai/issues/122.

## Getting started

To try it out, head over to our forks of Create React App (https://github.com/sweepai/create-react-app/issues) and Langchain (https://github.com/sweepai/langchain/issues). Make a quick ticket and prefix the title with "Sweep:" (not case-sensitive) and watch the magic happen. 🚀🔮

To install on your own repos, install at https://github.com/apps/sweep-ai. Then add the repository you want, make a quick ticket (e.g. writing tests), prepend the ticket with "Sweep:" and let Sweep handle the rest. 🛠️✅

## Privacy

Sweep does not store your code. Instead, on installation and updates, we embed your code and store them in a vector DB with reference to the file names and line numbers, but your code is not stored as plaintext. For our full privacy policy, check https://github.com/sweepai/.github/tree/main/privacy. 🔒
