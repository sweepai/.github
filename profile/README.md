## Hi there 👋

This is Sweep, an AI assistant to automate your software chores like bug fixes and minor feature requests when you spin up a ticket so you can focus on the complex engineering problems.

To get started, install https://github.com/apps/sweep-ai. Then add the repository you want, make a quick ticket (e.g. writing tests), add the label "sweep" and watch the magic happen.

For examples of tickets, check out our fork of Langchain: https://github.com/sweepai/langchain, which has Sweep installed.

Join as an alpha tester at https://discord.gg/j8XxQmpHEF.
