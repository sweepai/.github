[Sweep](https://github.com/sweepai/sweep) is an AI junior developer that transforms bug reports & feature requests into code changes.

Describe bugs, small features, and refactors like you would to a junior developer, and Sweep:
1. 🔍 reads your codebase
2. 📝 plans the changes
3. ⚡**writes a pull request with code**⚡

### Features 🌠

* 🌠 Turns issues directly into pull requests (without an IDE)
* 👀 Addresses developer replies & comments on its PRs
* 🔎 Uses embedding-based code search


### Why Sweep is Unique 🦄

Unlike Copilot, which only provides IDE based autocompletion, Sweep handles the entire flow end-to-end. Unlike ChatGPT, Sweep does not require pasting files.
