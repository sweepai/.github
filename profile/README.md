## Hi there 👋

This is Sweep, an AI assistant to automate your software chores like bug fixes and minor feature requests when you spin up a ticket so you can focus on the complex engineering problems.

To get started, install https://github.com/apps/sweep-ai. Then add the repository you want, make a quick ticket (e.g. writing tests), add the label "sweep" and watch the magic happen.

Join as an alpha tester at https://discord.gg/j8XxQmpHEF.

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
